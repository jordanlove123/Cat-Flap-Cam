# Cat Flap Cam
This project is intended to stop a pet from jumping through a door when it has an animal in its mouth. This program implements tensorflow to create a neural network that takes an image of an animal and returns 0 if it doesn't have an animal in its mouth and 1 if it does. In order to create the neural network, a custom dataset was used and this project also includes a script to create a neural network using a custom dataset.
